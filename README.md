# Page One - Screenwriter-Producer Matching App

Page One is a platform designed to connect screenwriters with producers in a simple, merit-based way. Writers can share snippets of their scripts, and producers can discover new talent without barriers. The goal is to create an open-minded, low-barrier entry platform that prioritizes great writing over trends or virality.

## Features

- **Writer Profiles**: Showcase your past work and genres of interest.
- **Producer Discovery**: Browse snippets of scripts to find your next project.
- **Confidentiality**: Writers control what producers see, with no full scripts shared until a match is made.
- **No Rating System**: Focus on the work, not on social metrics or ratings.
- **Simple Interface**: A minimal design to keep you focused on what matters â€” great scripts.
